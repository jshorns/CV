## Joey Hornsby

I've just graduated from Makers Academy, London's leading software development bootcamp, a 12 week intensive course covering OOP principles, Ruby and Javascript, several different frameworks and Agile group working practices. I am looking for my first role as a junior developer. After completing a PhD in French Literature, and working in publishing and then in policy before that, I wanted to come back to the professional world but bringing with me everything I loved about academic research; a sense of skill and constant learning, a level of commitment and self-driven development, and the joy of producing and perfecting something. On top of this, I wanted to find the same sense of participation in an active community engaged in the mutual discovery of new practices and ideas, with real-world application. This is what brought me to coding and software development. I've enjoyed the abstract, hard logic side of things in back-end work (unsurprising for a philosophy grad, cryptic crossword fan and chess dabbler), and the more concrete, visualised, constructive element of the front-end. I'm therefore currently characterising myself as full-stack, but am open to most roles; my priority for now is to learn and become the best dev I can be.

## Experience

**King's College London** (September 2017 to March 2021)  
_Graduate Teaching Assistant and PhD in French Literature_

- I completed my PhD with 3 years of full government (Arts and Humanities Research Council) funding, including a two month placement at an archive at the University of Austin with additional funding, necessitating self-drive and determination.
- I ran undergraduate seminars on French language, political cinema, and critical theory, teaching groups of up to 17 students. This required excellent communication skills and adaptability.
- Translation work from French to English, requiring attention to client needs as well as confidence in my own approach
- Presented work at conferences in London, Cambridge, Durham, Boston, and Paris, making me adept at putting forward my ideas.
- I co-organised one graduate conference at King's College London and one public conference at Birkbeck; we successfully found a publisher for a book based on the papers given at the latter (book forthcoming), showing our teamwork and drive.
- PhD title 'The Work of the Impossible: Reading Transgression through Labour in Georges Bataille'. 100,000 thesis requiring attention to detail across the entire document and consistency of logic.

**Department for Education** (November 2016 to July 2017)  
_Policy Advisor to the Teacher Workload and Development Team_

## Skills

#### Communication

I am a skilled communicator across a range of audiences, adept at taking on board the input of others but also diplomatically and confidently sharing my own ideas. This has been hugely useful in my time at Makers, both in working on group projects and in pair programming, particularly when there were clashes of working or learning style. I seek opportunities to lead and do so with confidence, always as a means of sharing and facilitating progress, as in my taking on mentoring responsibilities during Makers (I also volunteer with young people at a local charity). However, I am also able to take direction and take on board multiple and contrasting positions. I am able to negotiate difficult dynamics and address potential points of conflict before they develop, putting my own opinion forward whilst also allowing space for feedback and my own self-reflection.

#### Self-drive

I am a quick learner, adaptable and thrive under pressure. Makers prioritises self-led learning, and getting the most out of the course required tenacity and a willingness to take charge of my own development, researching projects and concepts on my own time, dealing with a huge quantity of new content in a short space of time. I always seek new opportunities to challenge myself. For example, in my second year I tutored for the Brilliant Club, a charity that places PhD tutors in state schools, and in my third year I completed a funded research placement in the US. Whilst at the Department for Education, furthermore, I spent two weeks working in the Permanent Secretary's office, experiencing an extremely fast-paced environment; this stood me in good stead for the high-pressure two weeks of the Makers final project.

#### Problem-solving and attention to detail

I have a thorough and detail orientated approach. I am able to apply a bigger picture holistic logic, as demonstrated by my PhD, but also have an aptitude for problem-solving on any scale. This enables be to maintain coherence and readability throughout code, but also to focus in on specific features or bugs and pursue them until they are completed or fixed. I'm a keen climber too, an activity which requires tactical thinking and strategising to solve problems, resourcefulness when a solution isn't immediately obvious, and the drive to keep persisting even in the face of frustration.

## Education

## Hobbies

I'm a hugely social person and I love getting involved in activities where I have the chance to meet and get to know new people, as well as hang out with the ones I already know! I spend a lot of time volunteering; I deliver parcels by bike for a food bank, and help out at a riding club in Brixton for local youth (Ebony Horse Club). In my rare quiet moments, I read, watch films, and do cryptic crosswords - otherwise I love climbing, cycling, yoga and running. I'm currently on two half marathons, so that makes a full one, right?
