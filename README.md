## Joey Hornsby

I am currently training to become a junior developer at Makers Academy. After completing a PhD in French Literature, and working in publishing and then in policy before that, I wanted to come back to the professional world but bringing with me everything I loved about academic research; a sense of skill and constant learning, a level of commitment and self-driven development, and the joy of producing and perfecting something. On top of this, I wanted to find the same sense of participation in an active community engaged in the mutual discovery of new practices and ideas, with real-world application. This is what brought me to coding and software development.

## Skills

#### Communication

I am a skilled communicator across a range of audiences, adept at taking on board the input of others but also diplomatically and confidently sharing my own ideas. Teaching seminar groups of up to 17 students at a time has necessitated the development of these skills. My earlier professional experience, meanwhile, has involved managing complex working relationships, communicating across internal teams and external stakeholders including members of the public. While working for a literary agency, furthermore, I mediated critical international relationships between clients and foreign publishers.


#### Self-drive

My PhD thesis is testament to my level of drive and self-motivation. I am a quick learner, adaptable and thrive under pressure; alongside my thesis I have sought opportunities to challenge myself, taking on teaching work and presenting opportunities. For example, in my second year I tutored for the Brilliant Club, a charity that places PhD tutors in state schools, and in my third year I completed a funded research placement in the US. Whilst at the Department for Education, furthermore, I spent two weeks working in the Permanent Secretary's office, experiencing an extremely fast-paced environment.

#### Attention to detail

My experience of academic and policy research has demanded a thorough and detail orientated approach. Planning and writing my thesis required a holistic logic and aptitude for problem-solving, to maintain coherence and readability throughout a 100,000 word document. I have also undertaken additional translation work, translating from French to English for a forthcoming publication; this necessitates both attention to detail and flexibility to ensure the brief is met without compromising the original material.

## Hobbies

I'm a hugely social person and I love getting involved in activities where I have the chance to meet and get to know new people, as well as hang out with the ones I already know! I spend a lot of time volunteering; I deliver parcels by bike for food bank, and help out at a riding club in Brixton for local youth (Ebony Horse Club). In my rare quiet moments, I read, watch films, and do cryptic crosswords - otherwise I love climbing, cycling, yoga and running. I'm currently on two half marathons, so that makes a full one, right?
